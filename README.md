# Inception

Inception is a project primarily written by OpenAI's ChatGPT. Its purpose is to demonstrate the capability of ChatGPT to generate code for various tasks with minimal human intervention.

The project consists of a set of Python scripts and tools for introspecting and sending code to ChatGPT, as well as for decoding and writing the code generated by ChatGPT.

**Current Capabilities:**
- Sending code files or directories to ChatGPT using the `isend` command.
- Decoding and writing files received from ChatGPT using the `idecode` command.
- Automatically generating function signatures for Python files.
- A Docker setup for easy deployment and testing.

This project is still a work in progress, and ChatGPT has contributed the majority of the code.

## TODO

1. **Checkpointing with git**: Automate git check-ins and add functionality to squash commits from a previous defined point once a change is somewhat fully baked. ChatGPT should be able to come up with the commit messages and the squash's.

2. **Direct communication with OpenAI API**: Implement a system that starts with GPT-3.5 and then attempts to talk to GPT-4 or prompts the user to manually send the task to GPT-4 when necessary.

3. **Send and/or receive code changes**: Reduce code duplication by finding a way to receive changes in a predictable manner instead of requesting full file contents.

4. **Ask ChatGPT to decide what sections of code to send for context**: Develop a system that uses a separate GPT instance, which understands its only purpose is to figure out which code matters to the tasks at hand.

5. **Add unit tests**: Incorporate unit tests to ensure the correctness and stability of the project.

6. **Lean on TDD for error checking**: Improve the development process by using Test-Driven Development (TDD), allowing ChatGPT to write tests and iterate on code more efficiently with fewer manual interventions.
