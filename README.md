# Inception

Inception is a project primarily written by OpenAI's ChatGPT. Its purpose is to demonstrate the capability of ChatGPT to generate code for various tasks with minimal human intervention.

The project consists of a set of Python scripts and tools for introspecting and sending code to ChatGPT, as well as for decoding and writing the code generated by ChatGPT.

**Current Capabilities:**
- Sending code files or directories to ChatGPT using the `isend` command.
- Decoding and writing files received from ChatGPT using the `idecode` command.
- Automatically generating function signatures for Python files.
- A Docker setup for easy deployment and testing.

This project is still a work in progress, and ChatGPT has contributed the majority of the code.

## Usage Example

Here's an example of how one might use Inception to write a new app and then modify it slightly:

1. First, run `isend hello_world.py` to read the existing code.

    ```
    [ .. user runs `isend hello_world.py` to read existing code ..]
    USER:

    [Reminder.md](prompts/Reminder.md)
    # CONTENT
    ## WRITE THIS FILE hello_world.py
    import random

    def print_hello_world():
        print("Hello, World!")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        print_hello_world()
    # NO MORE FILES FROM CHATGPT
    <example output of `inception-function-sigs`>

    You can see my existing code above.  My first task for you is to modify this script to print its message in one of 3 different random languages each time it's called.

    Don't forget, I can't understand code unless it's in a content block!
    ```

2. ChatGPT responds with a new content block:

ChatGPT:
    ```
    # CONTENT
    ## WRITE THIS FILE hello_world.py
    import random

    def print_hello_world():
        greetings = [
            "Hello, World!",  # English
            "Hola, Mundo!",   # Spanish
            "Bonjour, le Monde!"  # French
        ]
        greeting = random.choice(greetings)
        print(greeting)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        print_hello_world()
    # NO MORE FILES FROM CHATGPT
    ```

3. The user pastes the content block into `idecode`.

4. The user issues `git diff` locally to see the changes.

    ```
    [... user issues `git diff` locally ..]
    <example output of `git diff`>
    diff --git a/hello_world.py b/hello_world.py
    index 0a0b1c2..3d4e5f6 100644

    ```

## TODO

1. **Checkpointing with git**: Automate git check-ins and add functionality to squash commits from a previous defined point once a change is somewhat fully baked. ChatGPT should be able to come up with the commit messages and the squash's.

2. **Direct communication with OpenAI API**: Implement a system that starts with GPT-3.5 and then attempts to talk to GPT-4 or prompts the user to manually send the task to GPT-4 if necessary.

3. **Send and/or receive code changes**: Improve the process of sending code changes to ChatGPT by finding a more predictable way to present changes, reducing code duplication.

4. **Ask ChatGPT to decide what sections of code to send for context**: Develop a system that uses a separate GPT instance to figure out which code matters to the tasks at hand, making the process more efficient.

5. **Add unit tests**: Enhance the project by including unit tests for the various features and functionality.

6. **Lean on TDD for error checking**: Rely more on Test-Driven Development for error checking, allowing ChatGPT to write tests, [manually review them,] then write the code, return failures, and iterate on the solution with minimal human intervention.
