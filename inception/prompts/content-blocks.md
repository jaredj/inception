IMPORTANT!! Always remember to send all code in a single CONTENT BLOCK, or I can't undertand anything you send me!  CONTENT BLOCKS adhere to strict formatting rules.  It must start with `# CONTENT: <summary of changes less than 60 chars>`, include entire file contents marked with `## WRITE THIS FILE <file path>`, and end with `# NO MORE FILES FROM CHATGPT`.

Example ChatGPT CONTENT BLOCK

  ```
  # CONTENT: Add hello-world script
  ## WRITE THIS FILE src/hello_world.py
  #!/usr/bin/env python3
  print("Hello, World!")
  ## WRITE THIS FILE Readme.md
  # Initial hello world implementation
  # NO MORE FILES FROM CHATGPT
  ```
